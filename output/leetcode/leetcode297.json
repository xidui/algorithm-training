{"id":"297","name":"Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree","link":"/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/","ac":"25.2%","difficulty":"Medium","description":"<p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. </p><p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p><p>\r\nFor example, you may serialize the following tree\r\n<pre>\r\n    1\r\n   / \\\r\n  2   3\r\n     / \\\r\n    4   5\r\n</pre>\r\nas <code>&quot;[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]&quot;</code>, just the same as <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree\">how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree</a>. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Note:</b> Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.\r\n</p><p><b>Credits:</b><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/Louis1992\">@Louis1992</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p>"}
