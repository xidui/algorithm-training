Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.</p><p>Calling <code>next()</code> will return the next smallest number in the BST.</p><p><b>Note: </b><code>next()</code> and <code>hasNext()</code> should run in average O(1) time and uses O(<i>h</i>) memory, where <i>h</i> is the height of the tree. </p><p><b>Credits:</b><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://oj.leetcode.com/discuss/user/ts\">@ts</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p>"}
